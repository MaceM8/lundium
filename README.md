# Lundium

Goal of this library is to provide one base from which components could be shared and reused, thus offering one central point for further development and improvements.

yarn add lundium

```bash
npm install lundium
```

## Documentation

## Theming

Lundium also comes with its own themes yoou can use it by including `@lundium/theme-basic` in your project.
